# ü•ó LeftOver Hub (HooHacks2025 Project ‚Äì Food Sharing Web App)

## üåü Purpose
This Django web application was built during **HooHacks 2025** to help fight food waste and food insecurity. It allows **families and restaurants** to share surplus or soon-to-expire food by posting it online so others nearby can access it. The goal is to reduce food waste while providing free food to those who need it or simply want to avoid letting good food go uneaten.

## üí° How It Works
- **Post Food**: Users (families or restaurants) can create listings with the food name, expiration date, and pickup location.
- **Browse Listings**: Anyone can browse available food listings nearby.
- **Pick Up**: If interested, users can visit the listed location before the deadline to pick up the food for free.

This project promotes **sustainability**, **community sharing**, and supports people facing **food insecurity**.
