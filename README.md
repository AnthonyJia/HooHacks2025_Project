# HooHacks2025_Project

## Purpose
This Django app is a prototype that aims to make it easier for families/restaurants to donate food to people in need. This would reduce the amount of wasted food as well as provide sustenance for people.

## How does it work?
What we had in mind was that families/restaurants would post food on the website that would last a certain amount of time before it goes away. People who want the food can go to the posted location before the deadline to get some free food. 

## How to run?
Download this Github repo and install dependencies `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then run `python manage.py runserver`
